# myQuery

__NOTE:__ do NOT use jQuery to build myQuery. It is required for testing purposes only.  Using it will defeat the purpose of the lab, which is to understand how jQuery works.

JavaScript libraries are essential for building almost anything on the web, and one of the most common libraries is jQuery.  Most often you'll see it referenced as a `$`.  It is such a common tool sometimes people have a hard time thinking of the JavaScript language without it.  But at the end of the day it's just a library, like a Ruby gem, and it's important to realize that.

One of the most common uses of jQuery is to select elements in the DOM and do something to or with them.  The Document Object Model (DOM) is a collection of nodes that make up a tree data structure.  The nodes are often html elements. Nodes can have identifiers by their attributes, such as name, class, or id.  Nodes can also be identified by the type of element they are.

jQuery can also change properties of selected nodes, remove them, or add new ones.
We're going to create all this functionality ourselves before we use the library.

We'll be making these methods on a prototype called Library.  The creation of new selections with myQuery will be wrapped in the function expression myQuery.  Use this code in for `myQuery.js`

```javascript
function Library(elString){
  var selectedEl = this.getElement(elString);
  // we use [0] because we want the selected items to be somewhat 
  // difficult to access so that users of our library do not use it against our intentions
  // 0 has no special meaning; it is just a property
  // we could have used anything like selectEl or selectedElephant
  this[0] = selectedEl;
}

/* where your prototypical methods go... */

var myQuery = function(elString) {
  return new Library(elString);
}

// how to use this code (don't include it in your file.)
var myQuerySelectedElements = myQuery('div');
myQuerySelectedElements.remove(); // removes selected divs
```

## The Methods Needed for the `Library.prototype`
- `#getElement` should take a string as an argument and analyze that string for css selectors syntax and select accordingly.
  - ex. `"p"` should get all _paragraph_ elements
  - ex. `".blue"` should get all elements with the _class_ blue
  - ex. `"#red"` should get the element with the _id_ of red
- `#css` should add in line styling to every selected element based on arguments.
  - The first arg is the property type
  - The second arg is the new property
  - ex. `myQuerySelectedElements.css('color', 'red');`
- `#remove` should remove all selected elements.
  - ex. `myQuerySelectedElements.remove();`
- `#append` should add a new elements after a each selected element.
  - Takes one argument, which is the new element (assume it's correctly formatted).
  ex. `myQuerySelectedElements.append('<span>Hello</span>');`

There is an index.html file that you can experiment with your myQuery function.  Simply open up the console (`[CTRL + ALT + j]`), and have at it!
